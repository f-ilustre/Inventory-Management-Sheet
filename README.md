## Inventory Management Sheet

[This Google Sheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwZMilVAzngg5_5ut_g2mDthO7WWQZlbHIYyYk1-Rl8/edit?usp=sharing) was made for recording inventory movement based on physical documents.
Data on the inventory movement are encoded in a table format by a designated person.
The dashboard automatically calculates the ending inventory.

This sheet is one of two systems that track inventory. The other system is QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Accountant Edition.
Inventory transactions from QuickBooks can manually be uploaded in this sheet.
The sheet will automatically find any discrepancies between the transactions for further investigation.

There are 11 color-coded tabs. The 'Instructions' and 'Action Items' are colored in blue.
These were intended for the users of this sheet. Red-colored tabs are where inventory movement will be encoded based on physical documents.
Black-colored tabs are reserved for authorized users.
